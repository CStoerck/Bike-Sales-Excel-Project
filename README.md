# Bike Sales Analysis - Excel Portfolio Project

### Project Overview
---

This project explores a dataset from a fictional bike sales business to help the company better understand its customer base and identify which demographics are most likely to purchase bikes. The analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel, with a focus on creating an interactive dashboard to visualize key trends and insights.

### Data Source

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- **Income**: Customer's annual income in dollars.
- **Children**: Number of children in the customer's household.
- **Education**: The highest level of education attained by the customer.
- **Occupation**: The customer's occupation.
- **Home Owner**: Indicates whether the customer owns their home.
- **Cars**: Number of cars owned by the customer.
- **Commute Distance**: The distance the customer commutes to work.
- **Region**: The region where the customer resides.
- **Age**: The customer's age.
- **Age Bracket**: Age category (Adolescent, Middle Age, Old).
- **Purchased Bike**: Indicates whether the customer purchased a bike.

### Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel**: Data analysis, visualization

### Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

1. **Identify Key Demographics**: Determine which customer demographics are more likely to purchase a bike.
2. **Analyze Income and Purchase Trends**: Examine the relationship between annual income and bike purchases.
3. **Understand the Impact of Commute Distance**: Analyze how the distance customers commute to work influences their likelihood of buying a bike.

### Analysis Highlights

#### Income vs. Bike Purchases
- Customers with higher annual incomes are more likely to purchase bikes.
- There is a clear trend showing that as income increases, so does the likelihood of purchasing a bike.

#### Commute Distance and Bike Purchases
- Customers with shorter commute distances tend to purchase more bikes.
- This suggests that biking is a preferred mode of transportation for those living closer to their workplace.

#### Education and Occupation Insights
- Higher education levels are correlated with an increased likelihood of purchasing a bike.
- Occupations that are more active or health-conscious show higher bike purchase rates.

#### Family and Home Ownership
- Families with fewer children and fewer cars are more likely to purchase bikes.
- Homeowners are slightly more likely to buy bikes compared to renters.

### Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into the demographics and behaviors of customers who are most likely to purchase bikes. By understanding these factors, the bike sales business can tailor its marketing strategies to target the right customer segments more effectively.
