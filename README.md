## Project Overview
This project explores a dataset from a fictional bike sales business to help the company better understand its customer base and identify which demographics are most likely to purchase bikes. The analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel, with a focus on creating an interactive dashboard to visualize key trends and insights.

## Data Overview
The dataset used for this analysis includes customer demographics, income levels, car ownership details, and commute distances. The key objective was to explore the relationship between these variables and bike purchases.

#### Key Columns in the Dataset:
- **Income**: Annual income in dollars.
- **Cars**: Number of cars owned by customer.
- **Commute Distance**: Distance the customer commutes to work.
- **Age**: Customer's age.
  - **Age Bracket**: Age category (Adolescent, Middle Age, Old).
- **Purchased Bike**: Indicates whether the customer purchased a bike.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard creation.

## Methodology
#### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the inital data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Removed duplicate values
2. Handled missing values
3. Formatted data 
4. Categorized age into age brackets

#### Exploratory Data Analysis
The data was explored to understand the distribution of key variables such as age, income, car ownership, and commute distance. Excel's data filtering, pivot tables, and charting features were extensively used to visualize and analyze the data.

#### Dashboard Components
The dashboard includes four key charts:
1. **Average Income per Purchase**: Average income per purchase and differentiating between genders.
2. **Customer Age Bracket**: Categorized into adolescent, middle-aged, and old customers, showing their likelihood to purchase bikes.
3. **Number of Cars Owned**: Measuring the impact of car ownership on the likelihood of purchasing a bike.
4. **Commute Distance to Work**: Analyzing the impact of proximity to work on bike purchases.

#### Filters
Three filters were applied to the dashboard to allow for dynamic analysis:
1. **Marital Status**: Married or Single.
2. **Region**: Europe, North America, and Pacific.
3. **Education**: Bachelors, Graduate Degree, High School, Partial College, or Partial High School.

## Key Metrics and Insights
The analysis revealed several interesting insights:
- **Income vs. Bike Purchases**: Higher incomes were slightly more likely to lead to bike purchases, with minimal variation between male and female customers.
- **Age Bracket Analysis**: Middle-aged customers were significantly more likely to purchase a bike compared to adolescents and older customers.
- **Car Ownership**: There was a significant decrease in the likelihood of purchasing a bike as the number of cars owned increased. Customers with 0 cars owned were the most likely to purchase a bike.
- **Commute Distance**: Customers who lived less than 1 mile from work were significantly more likely to purchase a bike.

## Results
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the factors influencing bike purchases, enabling the fictional bike sales business to focus marketing efforts on key demographics. The interactive filters allow users to explore specific segments of the customer base and derive targeted insights.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend targetting marketing efforts to key demographics who are most likely to purchase a bike:
- **Middle-Aged Customers**: Craft messages that resonate with the middle-aged lifestyle. Highlight the health benefits, convenience, and eco-friendliness of biking.
- **0-1 Car Customers**: Create a marketing campaign that specifically target households with no vehicles or just one vehicle. Emphasize the cost savings and environmental benefits of using a bike as an alternative mode of transportation.
- **Higher Income Customers**: Develop premium bike models or partner with luxury bike brands that cater to the more affluent customers.
- **Short Commute Customers**: Promote the convenience of biking for short commutes and the health benefits associated with it, particularly in urban areas where traffic congestion is a concern. Collaborate with local businesses to provide benefits for employees who bike to work.
